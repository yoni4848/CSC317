# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)

I think everyone on our team did an excellent job. There are elements I appreciate from each person's work. We picked and chose the best parts of each styling approach to create hybrid.css. I believe we were able to achieve these impressive results and work together effectively because we communicated with each other well throughout the project. Everyone was clearly assigned their specific task from the beginning, which helped us stay organized and productive as we worked on the assignment.
I worked on hand-wtitten part with Yonas whereas other members worked on AI part. Everyone did a great job on their parts, we faced some problems on github but we were able to solve it with our teamwork. Yonas worked on body at first, I did nav, header, and footer according to what he has already set up. I faced some issues while maiking hover. Other than that, it was flawless with the help of my group mates. We made a disocrd server to communicate with eachother on discord which helped us to keep everything clear. Overall, I think we did a good work.
I believe as a group we did a great job when it came down to communication and getting the code done. As I worked on my section, Yonas provided feedback on my prompt and make sure I was able to have a functional css. Our team also picked great parts of the styling to complete our hybrid.css section. Overall our team did great working together and keeping eachother on track. 


## Individual Reflections

### [Yonas Melkie] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1) + Ai css-3
Working on this group assignment showed me how professionals use tools like GitHub to collaborate on projects. By teaming up with others, working on different branches, and merging our work, I got hands-on experience with GitHub workflows that are so important in software development. I was responsible for hand-writing the CSS for the body section and creating some AI-generated CSS using text prompts. My teammates, who worked on AI-generated CSS with both image and text prompts, did an outstanding job—our final result really demonstrated the creative power of AI tools in web development. This assignment helped me see how AI can boost productivity and let me express my creativity in new ways. Comparing my hand-written CSS to the AI-generated designs was eye-opening. Writing CSS by hand helped me understand each style property in detail, but the AI methods produced impressive, complex designs much faster. This whole experience changed how I think about being a developer in today’s AI-driven world.

### [Adarsha Bomjan] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2) + Ai css-4
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]
From this assignment I learned how to do a collaborative work on github without conflicting with eachother. Sending pull requests, creating branches, and working on that branch before sending pull request inorder to merge it with main, these things helped me and my teammates work smoothly. Also making an idea and following same idea helped us make our work easy.
For the gripu work I did hand-written part with Yonas, he was working on body section while I was working on header, nav, and footer. At first, I thought it is going to be confusing and difficult to work on same file but it was way easier and smoother than I expected.

### [Roberto Ledesma Toledo] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[Individual reflection on AI prompting experience and lessons learned]
For the AI text prompt CSS part of the project I took the time to make sure i covered every part of the html file in the CSS prompt. I also wanted to have more of darker color for the background color and also added a cyan color for the hover. I also mentioned in the prompt that it should work on different devices.

My teamates and I worked on making sure any small issues in the AI CSS output is fixed. The only issue was the logo being more visible and the margin between the nav bar and the margin between the logo and the top of the website. While working on these fixes I also practiced more of the git prompts.


### [Favour Godbless] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS 

For my part of the project, I used an image reference from brittanychiang.com along with our group’s index.html file to create a dark, modern version of our portfolio. I wanted the site to look clean, professional, and easy to read, so I focused on a dark background, teal accents, and smooth animations that make it feel alive.

I worked with my teammates to fix small issues, like making the logo more visible and adjusting the layout for phones. I ended up using the brightness(0) invert(1) filter to make the logo stand out better against the dark background. Overall, this task taught me how to guide AI tools to get a design that actually fits the code we already have, and how small details can make a big difference in how a website feels.

## Group Preferred Version
The group preferres the AI version 3, we chose that because it looked unique and clean compared to the other versions which looked a bit simmilar. 


## Collaboration Experience
We worked together by collaborting on github and communicating on Discord. 
Some of the challenges we faced include:
- merge conflicts
- getting familiar with github
- creating a new pull request was a challege time to time

Other than those everything was smooth.
