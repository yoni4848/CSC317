Favour Godbless – AI Image + Text Prompt CSS

For my part of the project, I used an image reference from brittanychiang.com along with our group’s index.html file to create a dark, modern version of our portfolio. I wanted the site to look clean, professional, and easy to read, so I focused on a dark background, teal accents, and smooth animations that make it feel alive.

I worked with my teammates to fix small issues, like making the logo more visible and adjusting the layout for phones. I ended up using the brightness(0) invert(1) filter to make the logo stand out better against the dark background. Overall, this task taught me how to guide AI tools to get a design that actually fits the code we already have, and how small details can make a big difference in how a website feels.
