# Assignment 4 Submission

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based calculator that works like a phone calculator app. Users can perform basic math operations through button clicks or keyboard input.

## Features

The calculator includes:
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Percent calculation for finding percentages
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- Backspace to delete one digit at a time
- Sign toggle button to switch between positive and negative numbers
- Decimal point support for precise calculations

## Implementation

The calculator uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The display shows input numbers and results. Event listeners capture both button clicks and keyboard presses, making the calculator easy to use.

Error handling prevents crashes from invalid operations like dividing by zero. The code separates each math operation into its own function for clarity. Variables track the current state, including the first number, second number, and selected operation.

## Keyboard Support

Users can type numbers and operators directly. The Enter key works as equals, Backspace deletes digits, and Escape resets the calculator completely.
